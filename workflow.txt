1. Pick profile
2. If it matches one of the default version profiles, offer to create a new profile
3. Install mod
4. Edit JSON
5. ???
6. Profit

However, there's alot more to it than just installing the mod
1. locate the jar and rename it to a .zip so we can safely extract it.
2. Once it's extracted, we have to extract the individual mods to temp folders and copy their contents inside of the folder that contains our extracted jar
3. Re-compress the jar to a zip
4. Backup the old jar
5. Delete the current (not the backup)
6. Rename the zip to reflect the old jar name
